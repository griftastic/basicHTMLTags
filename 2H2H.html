    <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            Too Hot to Handle is a reality TV show where conventionally attractive people are made to live in a resort in paradise. They are allowed to do whatever they want, except for one thing. They are not allowed to engage in any sexual activity, including kissing. If contestants break the rules, they lose money out of a pool of $100,000.

    <h2>Review:</h2>
        <p>
            Too Hot to Handle can be best described as "cringey". Although it is a very binge-worthy show to watch, it is mostly due to the fact that it resembles a dumpster fire. Who can look away from such a thing? In the end, I still enjoy this show, and I found myself screaming at my TV more than I normally do.
