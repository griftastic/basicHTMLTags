    <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            Survivor is a reality TV show where competitors are split up into two different tribes and made to live on an island for 39 days. Throughout their time, they compete in a series of physical challenges meant to test their abilities while surviving on basically nothing but rice. After these challenges, the losing tribe needs to go to Tribal Council, where they choose someone to vote off.

    <h2>Review:</h2>
        <p>
            Survivor is definitely one of my all time favorite shows to watch. The combined drama between the physical challenges and the social discourse makes this show super interesting to watch all around. After over 40 seasons, this show has definitely stood the test to time, as it adapts and changes to keep things fresh.
