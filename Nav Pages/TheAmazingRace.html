    <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>
            The Amazing Race is a reality show where contestants are made to compete in challenges across the world. They start off in one location, usually within the United States, and are required to buy plane tickets to a destination, where there are many cultural challenges set up for them. After contestants complete these challenges, they race toward the finish line in the hopes of not being in last place. People who arrive last are in jeopardy of being eliminated.

    <h2>Review:</h2>
        <p>
            In the world of COVID, The Amazing Race is such a refreshing show to turn on. When traveling is extremely limited, it's nice to see what the rest of the world looks like. The way contestants interact with each other is quite interesting too. Sometimes they work together, and other times, everyone is against other teams for seemingly no reason. This dynamic makes it quite fresh, and fun to watch as a whole.
